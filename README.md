wikisource language analysis

This project aims to automate Language Analysis of Gujarati Wiki Source Project's
Pages. Later on it should be extended to Main Gujarati Wikipedia pages as well.

The main Script reads the URLs of the Gujarati WikiSource Pages from a file called 
"page_names.txt". It assumes that it matches th the page's page title part on 
Guj. Wikisource. If we want to bypass the URLs that we have already processed 
adding a colon (:) character and writing "Done" after it would make this program 
ignore it.
