# wmflab-la
Generic language analysis code meant to be hosted on wmflab VPS.

This project aims to automate Language Analysis of Gujarati Wiki Source and 
Gujarati Wikipedia Project's Pages.

It is started from cloning the project wsla project. This forking was essential as
wmflab's python support is for python version 3.5 while wsla project used to utilise
features from python 3.6 hence the requirement to backport the code arose.
